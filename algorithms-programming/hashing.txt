We do usually think of them as O(1), and I think that's ok because in practice they do average/amortize O(1) and everybody knows what is meant (right?) and they're usually just a small building block in the actual algorithm. Would be pretty annoying if we had to always asterisk the complexity discussion of every algorithm that uses hash tables. But here, the set data structure isn't just a helping part in the actual thing we're building. It is the actual thing. And we're explicitly required to achieve O(1), it's even the problem title. So I think we shouldn't be sloppy here.
