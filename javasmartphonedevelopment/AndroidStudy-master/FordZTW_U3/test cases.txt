The input is from OptionSet0.txt, OptionSet1.txt, OptionSet2.txt, 
there are 3 different models, one in each file. I print the price for all models in the beginning.

Then, I started two threads to change an option in the first model:
autoEdit1.editOptionPrice("FordZTW", "Brakes", "Standard", 100);
autoEdit2.editOptionPrice("FordZTW", "Brakes", "Standard", 200);
Then price will change from 19390 to 19490 and 19590 respectivly. 
In each thread, the edit function is called for 6 times, this is to show
the thread will not be preempted during the editing.
