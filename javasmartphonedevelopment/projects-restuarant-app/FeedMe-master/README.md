# FeedMe
FeedMe shows daily deals offered by local restaurants and bars. Users can save their favorite deals, share them with friends, or get directions to restaurants using Google Maps. Users can also help the community by submitting new deals they've seen around town.

FeedMe is based on a Parse.com backend, which handles user authentication, information storage, and relationships. The app is currently supported only in the Bryan/College Station, TX area, but is set up to be scaled to any city in the nation effortlessly.
