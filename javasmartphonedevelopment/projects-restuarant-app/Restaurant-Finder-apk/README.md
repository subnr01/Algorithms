App name:  Restaurant Finder

Opportunity:

In Limerick there are numerous restaurant with unique daily specials, knowing the specials can persuade potential customers to visit a specific restaurant.
Many of these restaurants have a Facebook page where they update information, but a great marketing opportunity exists to band together in an area, to save costs while keeping customers coming into all the restaurants in the area.


Need it meets: 

This app will give the user access to menus and other relevant information for restaurants in the Limerick city area.


Revenue potential:

There are three options here; offer a free app with ads to generate revenue on a per-click basis, second offer a paid and free version of the application – the free version having limited features and the paid version have more complex features. The third and final option is to use a combination of the two – with adds on the free version and none on the paid version. My preference would be to have a free with adds, based on this type application there are an average of 5000 -10000 downloads and installs.


Vision Statement:  

The mobile application will be a valuable resource to all Limerick people and anyone visiting Limerick who eats out. Normally they would have to pick a restaurant they liked at almost random because they did not know what would be on the menu (specials) on any given day. But with the growing popularity of smart devices, this information could be presented to the user in a readily available, easy to read format.


Major features:

The initial release will have 4 core functions from below:

		•	Post full menu for every restaurant in the app (plus hours/map)
		•	Updates daily specials for all the different restaurants in one convenient place for people
		•	Offer one or more daily deals – incentive to download app, show the app in a participating restaurant to get a deal.
		•	Let customers request a daily special… you could even make it a game letting people vote for the one they want

The initial release will have 4 core functions from above: incorporating - local and remote storage, geo-location and connecting to a web service. The planned initial release will be freely available with with ads.

In the future, the more complex feature features will be added to the app. It will remain free using ads to generate revenue.

Operation Environment:

The system will be dependent on a geographical area i.e. Limerick.

The system shall operate in all version of Android back as far as gingerbread 2.3.

The user will be required to authenticate them selves to use the system.

Any data will be stored in a database to provide security.

JSON or XML will be needed for data transfer between the web service and the app.



Competitive Analysis:

The biggest rival would be trip advisor, who offer information online via a website but they also have a mobile application supporting most platforms. Trip advisor offers a lot of information (Hotels, Restaurants, Attractions, Nightlife etc.) to tourist and potential visitors, i.e. business people. My app will cater to a more niche market of just restaurants in the limerick area, it would be targeted at the same people as trip advisors app but would also hugely target locals in the limerick area.
Trip advisor only offers location and reviews to the user, but I will be offering the menus available at restaurants along with daily specials and deals. There are other restaurant finders available but none seem to work in Ireland let alone Limerick with most based in the US.
