1. Calculate the total time required to transfer a 1000-KB file between two hosts
connected by a link that support packets of size 1 KB in the following cases. You
can assume that the sum of processing delay, queuing delay and propagation delay
to send a packet from one host to the other is 25 ms.

a. The bandwidth of the link is 1.5 Mbps and data packets can be sent
continuously without waiting for any acknowledgment from the other host
that the packets were received without any errors. (4 points)

b. The bandwidth of the link is 1.5 Mbps and the sending host can send the
next packet only after receiving an acknowledgment from the receiving
host that the previous packet was received error-free. For the purpose of
this problem, assume that all packets are received without any errors and
acknowledgment packet size is negligible (no transmission delays). (4 points)

c. The bandwidth is “infinite” and the sending host can send up to 19 next
packets while it is waiting to receive an acknowledgment from the
receiving host for a particular packet. (6 points)

d. The bandwidth is “infinite” and the sending host can send (22-1) packets
after receiving the acknowledgment for the first packet, send (23-1 )
additional packets after receiving the acknowledgment for the packets sent
in the previous step, (24-1 ) additional packets after receiving the
acknowledgment for the packets sent in the previous step and so on…(a
justification for exponential increase will be provided when discussing
transport protocols in the course). (6 points)

2. The motivation behind this problem is to quantitatively evaluate the advantages of
packet switching over circuit switching. You will need to know and remember
basic probability theory (specifically binomial distribution, normal distribution)
and are welcome to use (and cite) other sources to solve this problem. To solve
this problem first, we will compute probabilities of coin tosses and apply the
result to the circuit switching/packet switching debate.

a. When tossed, an unfair coin lands as “Heads” with probability p and lands
as “Tails” with probability 1-p. 

	i. If this coin is tossed 10 times, what is the probability of obtaining
	the following sequence of heads (H) and tails (T) –
	HTTTHHTTTT? (2 points)

	ii. If this coin is tossed 10 times, what is the probability of obtaining
	exactly three “Heads”? (3 points)

	iii.If this coin is tossed 10 times, what is the probability of obtaining
	at least three “Heads”? (5 points)

	iv. What is the “Normal approximation” to the Binomial distribution?
	You are free to use other sources for this as long as you cite it. (5
	points) 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

b. Assume you are given a 1 Mbps link that is to be shared amongst a set of
users in an institution to connect their computers. Assume that each users
data rate is 100 kbps and each user actively uses the link for 10% of the
time.

	i. How many users can be supported if we use circuit switching over
	this link? (5 points)

	ii. Assume that your institution decides to use packet switching and
	decides to share the link amongst 50 users. What is the probability
	that more than 10 users are active at any time? (Hint: Determine
	the probability in the form you determined in 2.a.iii and then apply
	the results from 2.a.iv to compute the probability). (10 points)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Suppose N packets arrive simultaneously to a link at which no packets are
currently being transmitted or queued. Each packet is of length L bytes and the
link has a transmission rate R. What is the average queuing delay for the N
packets? (10 points) 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Suppose packets can be dropped or arbitrarily delayed inside a packet network.
Two users who use this network are required to terminate their session by telling
each other that they are ending the session. We would like to design a session
termination protocol that exchanges packets in such a way that both users know
that they can terminate and no further packets will arrive from this user or the 
other user? Can such a protocol be designed? If yes, provide a specification of
your protocol. If no, explain clearly the reason why such a protocol cannot be
designed. (15 points)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Networking utilities whois, traceroute and ping. You will need access to a
Unix machine for the following problem. If you can’t find anything else, you can
always use the Andrew Unix machines (e.g. unix.andrew.cmu.edu) for this
problem. (25 points)

a. The Unix utility whois can be used to find the domain name
corresponding to an organization, or vice versa. The information is
provided by a domain name registration service provider. Read the man
page for whois and experiment with it. For example, try whois
disney.com. The response should tell you that disney.com is
registered on the server whois.melbourneit.com owned by
MELBOURNE IT. To probe further try whois –h
whois.melbourneit.com cnet.com. Try whois
stanford.edu and whois mit.edu as well. Here is what you need
to turn in

	i.Provide the name of the technical contact for the domain
	cmu.edu and disney.com

	ii. Give both the English language names and the internet addresses
	of all nameservers for disney.com. 




b. The Unix utility ping can be used to find the round trip time (RTT) to
various Internet hosts. See the man page for ping to learn how to use
ping and its various options. The options can be used to control the time
between ping packet transmissions, and to display the resulting round
trip times. When the execution of ping is interrupted, the min, average
and maximum RTT are displayed by the utility. Here is what you turn in

	i. Report the average (average over five pings) round trip times
	for pings to one of the nameservers for mit.edu and for
	stanford.edu. If there are multiple nameservers for a domain,
	use the first one listed. List the nameserver that you used for
	computing the RTT time.



c. The Unix utility traceroute is like ping, but it sends packets that are
limited to go one hop, then two hops, then three hops, and so on, towards
a given destination, and the intermediate routers are reported. Read the 
man page for traceroute and experiment with it.

	i. Try traceroute to the nameserver to standford.edu. Use
	the traceroute options so that delays are reported for 5
	packets. How do the delays reported by traceroute compare to
	the delays reported by ping. Attach a printout of your output (no
	more than 1 page even if you have to truncate it).
	ii. Try traceroute to the nameserver to mit.edu. Use the
	traceroute options so that delays are reported for 5 packets.
	List the name and IP address of the 5th router encountered. How do
	the delays reported by traceroute compare to the delays
	reported by ping. (No need to attach any outputs for this
	problem).
